Welcome!

This repository is an umbrella for the three repositories previously hosted on code.google.com:
* http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/
* http://code.google.com/p/thread-sanitizer/
* http://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/

Since those projects started, most of the code has been moved to the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure (http://llvm.org). Here reside some pieces of infrastructure and documentation.
